# Generate a database migration without dropping custom tables.

## Usage

Run the following command in your applicationâ€™s root directory:

`vendor/bin/doctrine-migrations diff`

If you have mapping modifications, this will create a new migration file under `data/doctrine/migrations/` directory.
Opening the migration file, you will notice that it contains some queries that will drop your `oauth_*` tables because they are unmapped (there is no doctrine entity describing them).
You should delete your latest migration with the DROP queries in it as we will create another one, without the DROP queries in it.
In order to avoid dropping these tables, you need to add a parameter called `filter-expression`.

The command to be executed without dropping these tables looks like this:

On Windows (use double quotes):

`vendor/bin/doctrine-migrations diff --filter-expression="/^(?!oauth_)/"`

On Linux/macOS (use single quotes):

`vendor/bin/doctrine-migrations diff --filter-expression='/^(?!oauth_)/'`


## Filtering multiple unmapped table patterns

If your database contains multiple unmapped table groups, then the pattern in `filter-expression` should hold all table prefixes concatenated by pipe character (`|`).
For example, if you need to filter tables prefixed with `foo_` and `bar_`,  then the command should look like this:

On Windows:

`vendor/bin/doctrine-migrations diff --filter-expression="/^(?!foo_|bar_)/"`

On Linux/macOS:

`vendor/bin/doctrine-migrations diff --filter-expression='/^(?!foo_|bar_)/'`


## Troubleshooting

On Windows, running the command in PowerShell might still add the `DROP TABLE oauth_*` queries to the migration file.
This happens because for PowerShell the caret (`^`) is a special character, so it gets dropped (`"/^(?!oauth_)/"` becomes `"/(?!oauth_)/"` when it reaches your command).
Escaping it will not help either.
In this case, we recommend running the command:
* directly from your IDE
* using `Linux shell`
* from the `Command Prompt`


## Help

You can get more help with this command by running:

`vendor/bin/doctrine-migrations help diff`
